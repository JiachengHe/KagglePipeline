# KagglePipeline

This R package aims to automate the workflow of data analysis and ML modeling in Kaggle competitions.

It requires to import dplyr, ggplot2, caret packages.

Currently it provides functions such as creating dummies for categorical features, separately plotting numerical features and categorical features, randomly imputing missing values, transforming categorical features into linear model fit. All functionality supports automation on the whole data set.

I am working on adding new functions to automate transforming text features into linear model fit, models blending, autosaving model tuning results, etc.

I am trying to apply this package on Titanic competition and House Price competition.
